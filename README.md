## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
2. Run `npm run dev` to start testing.

## Usage

Node Solid Server can be used for:

- Implementing and testing new features following clean architecture principles.
- Writing tests using the Vitest framework to ensure the correctness of implemented features.
- Executing tests with Vitest to validate the functionality of the application.
- Integrating the project into larger Node.js applications to demonstrate effective structuring and testing practices.

## Dependencies

- `typescript`: A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to the language.
- `date-fns`: Modern JavaScript date utility library that provides various functions to work with dates
